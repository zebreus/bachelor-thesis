The rust-hdl rust crate enables us to write RTL logic in rust and generate verilog from it. In this post we will setup a `rust-hdl` project, generate some verilog and deploy that to a FPGA. Our first goal will be to blink the LEDs on the tang nano 9k board.

== Setup a `rust-hdl` project

First we create a new cargo project by running `cargo init --bin` and add rust-hdl as a dependency by running `cargo add rust-hdl`. Then we copy the quickstart example from the https://github.com/samitbasu/rust-hdl#quickstart[rust-hdl git repo] into a `quickstart.rs` file and adjust our main function to call the quickstart example.
