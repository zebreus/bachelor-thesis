== Abstract

// A short summary of the contents in English of about one page. The following
// points should be addressed in particular:

// * Motivation: Why did this work come about? Why is the topic of the
// work interesting (for the general public)? The motivation should be
// abstracted as far as possible from the specific tasks that may be given
// by a company.
// * Content: What is the content of this thesis? What exactly is covered in
// the thesis? The methodology and working method should be briefly
// discussed here.
// * Results: What are the results of this work? A brief overview of the
// most important results as a teaser to read the complete thesis.

// [NOTE]
// ====
// A great guide by Kent Beck how to write good abstracts can be found here:
