= High-Level Synthesis from Rust

== Background

Digital circuits are typically designed using hardware description languages (HDLs) like Verilog or VHDL. High-level synthesis (HLS) is a process that enables the design of digital circuits in a high-level language, such as C or C++. HLS allows designers to write their design at a higher level of abstraction which can be more natural and familiar to software developers.

The generated circuits can be deployed to FPGAs. That can offer higher performance and lower power consumption, which can be particularly useful for applications such as video processing, image processing, and telecommunications.

== Issue

Currently the source languages for HLS are usually limited subsets of C/C\++ with some additional restrictions. Rust could be a better source for HLS, because it already has some restrictions for dealing with memory that could proof beneficial for HLS. For example its semantics define memory and ownership more clearly than C/C++.

There are some ways how toolchains for HLS from Rust can be build with currently existing tooling. However it is currently not known how viable these different toolchains would be for practical application specifically what restrictions would apply, if and how they could benefit from the additional information provided by Rust.

== Objectives and hypothesis

The main objective is to create an overview about how HLS from Rust can be achieved with state of the art technologies.

Objectives
* Create and document toolchains for HLS from Rust.
* Evaluate and compare the toolchains.
* Package the toolchains in some reusable way.
* Figure out how to leverage Rust to improve the toolchains. (maybe)

Hypotheses:
* There are ways to build toolchains for HLS from Rust by using existing tools.
* Rust can be used to improve HLS in some way.

If these objectives are fulfilled a next step could be to analyze how specific features of Rust could be used to improved.

== What needs to be done

I identified five main tasks that need to be done. 

1. Discovering possible pathways to perform HLS from Rust with existing tools.
2. Building and documenting one or more toolchains for each pathway.
3. Defining a methodology for comparing the toolchains.
4. Comparing the toolchains.
5. Analyzing the results.

They could be divided into a group for creating toolchains (1, 2) and for evaluating toolchains (3, 4, 5).

== State of research

There is currently one report investigating the viability of Rust as a source for HLS <<Har22>>. The DSLX language for HLS is similar to Rust but has some limitations <<DSLX>>.

Until recently HLS was only possible from C/C++ based languages <<Nan16>>. Recently the CIRCT project from LLVM and the XLS project from google also started on building creating flexible systems for HLS <<XLS>> <<Nor18>>.

There also is research on performing HLS from LLVM IR. Specifically the LLVM CIRCT project has worked on HLS.
