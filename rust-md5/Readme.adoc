= A simple md5 implementation in Rust

This crate provides a simple md5 implementation based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5#Pseudocode[the example from wikipedia] in Rust.

md5 seems to be a reasonable algorithm for testing HLS, because it has some computational complexity, requires some additional data and is easy to implement.

The interface of the function is kept in C style, because that makes HLS and testing easier.
