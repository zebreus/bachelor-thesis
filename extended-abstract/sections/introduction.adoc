The popularity of the Rust programming language is rising and it is one of the most loved new programming languages. It integrates modern tooling like standardized dependency management, testing, documentation generation, formatting and building. In the future, the adoption will probably increase further and it could replace {cpp} as the most common system programming language <<Bug22>>.
It is possible that Rust also provides benefits in domains other than systems programming. It has been shown that Rust can be used for other domains such as GPU programming, web development or logic programming <<Sah22>> <<Byc22>> <<Kyr22>>. This enables us to use some of the benefits of Rust <<Bug22>> <<Cos19>>.

This paper will explore how Rust can be used in the domain of FPGA firmware development. Usually, FPGA firmware is developed in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) such as Verilog or VHDL. In these languages, the programmer has to describe the hardware in detail. This is a low-level approach that can lead to efficient designs, but it is quite time-consuming <<Mil20>>. The rust-hdl project enables us to express hardware descriptions in Rust similar to traditional HDLs <<rusthdl>>. In addition to manually writing hardware descriptions in an HDL, it is also possible to use High-level synthesis (HLS) to generate hardware descriptions in HDLs from an algorithmic description written in high-level programming languages. This provides increased productivity at the cost of slightly less optimized designs <<Mil20>>. This process is currently mostly used with C or {cpp} because they are the most common system programming languages. There are multiple HLS tools available that can synthesize HDL code from {cpp} code. Multiple of these tools are based around the LLVM compiler infrastructure <<Nan16>>. There is one reported use of Rust as an HLS language but that is of no use to us as their tools are not available <<Har22>>. As Rust is also based on LLVM, it is possible that it can be used with these tools too. 

To figure out whether Rust can be used as a source language for HLS, we searched for HLS tools that can be used for Rust. We developed a modular process for integrating HLS tools with rust-hdl <<rusthdl>>. We used this process to implement a proof-of-concept integration with the PandA Bambu HLS framework and showed that it is possible to use Rust as a source language for HLS. We also evaluated the resulting solution by synthesizing a simple example. We found that the solution is not yet suitable for production use, but that it is a promising starting point for further development.
