== Summary

We showed that High-level synthesis from Rust is possible and described a prototype implementation using PandA Bambu. The biggest limitation is that it does not support the synthesis of functions that could crash. We also showed that the Rust language, its build system and the package registry can be used for hardware design. 

// We believe that this work is another step towards a Rust-based hardware design.
