= BambU HLS

BambU can perform High-Level Synthesis (HLS) of LLVM IR. It is packaged as a nix derivation based on the upstream appimage release.

You can convert an LLVM file to verilog using:

```bash
nix run github:zebreus/bachelor-thesis#bambu-appimage -- --compiler=I386_CLANG12 --top-fname=NAME_OF_THE_FUNCTION_IN_YOUR_LLVM_IR  FILE.ll 
```

This will produce a NAME_OF_THE_FUNCTION_IN_YOUR_LLVM_IR.v file. It will also generate a bunch of other files, but you can ignore them.

== Compiling BambU from source

I failed to compile bambu from source on nixos. I left my current attempt in the `default.nix` file.
