= rust_hls_macro_lib

This library contains helper functions shared between the `rust_hls_macro` and the `rust_hls_lib` crates.

This crate will contain

* Everything related to parsing the attribute macro. (`#[hls( ... )]`)
* Some functions for checking that the macro is used correctly.

This crate uses darling::Error as its error type, because that supports bundling errors and span information.
