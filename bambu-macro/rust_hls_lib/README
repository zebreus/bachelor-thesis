Functions for performing HLS from Rust

This crate provides functions for performing HLS from Rust. It is intended to be used with the `rust_hls` crate which provides a macro using the functions in this crate.

High-level synthesis is performed by ripping out a function an creating a new (temporary) crate that only exports that function.
A bash script containing the commands to synthesize the temporary crate is then created and executed.
The resulting Verilog is then returned as a string.
