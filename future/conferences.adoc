.Methodology
[%collapsible]
====
The list is created by first collecting all conference papers that I used in my bachelors thesis. I will add those conferences. Then I look into all of the papers that are talking about HLS or modern HDLs and add the conference papers from their sources.

After that I rank all the conferences by relevance. Then I add their website, relevance, location, deadlines and cost.
